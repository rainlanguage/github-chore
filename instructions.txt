@coderabbitai assess this PR size (PR diff) for the totality of the PR with the following criterias and report it in your comment:

- the assessment must be for the totality of the PR, that means comparing the base branch to the last commit of the PR 
- only include the relevant and main source files and changes in your assessment, for example changes in generated files such as lock files should be excluded 
- the assessment should be in the format of: ADDITIONS=number DELETIONS=number TOTAL=number , where TOTAL is sum of ADDITIONS and DELETIONS 
- the PR size is for the most part the same as the PR diff, but excluding the diff of irrevelant files that were explained earlier 
- no other text and explanation should be in your comment, just the number of additions, deletions and total that you have assessed 
- you assessment comment should also not include any of your tips or other sections 
- do NOT tag me or anyone else on your comment
